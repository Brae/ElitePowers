    <info>Zachary Hudson is the President of the Federation. He is a Republican, and like the rest of his party he believes the government has a responsibility to be as small a burden on the individual as possible, embodied in his policy of reducing taxes. This policy is popular, apart from with those who relied on government support before he was elected. Hudson is an advocate of personal freedom at any cost, requiring individual responsibility for oneself. He supports the use of the CQC Championship simulation for recruitment and training of the Federal Navy. He is a hunter, and a friend of Admiral Vincent - the Navy officer in behind the controversial decision to firebomb Onionhead crops on Panem.</info>
