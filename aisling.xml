    <info>Testing! Lady Aisling Duval is a princess of the Empire, the eldest child of Prince Harold Duval. Initially she claimed that she was the natural successor to the late Emperor Hengist Duval, but after the Senate decision she supported Arissa Lavigny-Duval's claim. Aisling Duval enjoys support from elements who would benefit from shaking up Imperial society. Unlike other key persons in the Empire, she is against Imperial Slavery. She supports a non-government organization by the name of Stop Slavery Stupid. She also thinks narcotics should be made illegal in the Empire, at least partially because her mother died of narcotics use.</info>
